# AppJamPlus
The Projects that the students and I created at AppJam+

AppJam+ is an organization by "Dreams for School".
Dreams for Schools was established to inspire, create and educate students to be STEM literate with hard and soft skills needed to become the critical thinkers, creative leaders and technologists of tomorrow.

In this repository I've included the projects that my students and I created while I was mentoring them.
The projects are Android apps that are supposed to teach STEM to elementary school children.
